This program implements a binary tree and some of its basic operations like adding nodes, removing nodes, and walking the tree.

This is my first Ruby program so very likely it does not follow Ruby's best practices or the Ruby way of doing things but it's a start.

Feel free to comment and/or reach me if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.
