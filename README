This project implements a binary tree class and a class to draw the binary tree.

Class BinaryTree implements the binary tree and its basic operations (adding nodes, removing nodes, and walking the tree)

Class BinaryTreeDrawer implements the code to "draw" the binary tree. This class does not draw the tree per-se but rather calculates the coordinates where each node should be drawn and calls a specified block to do the actual drawing.


WHERE TO START
--------------
* sample_string.rb shows a very basic example on how to add nodes to the tree.

* sample_integers.rb shows how to add nodes, remove nodes, and find nodes on the tree.

* sample_people.rb shows an example on how to add nodes from a custom class the implements Comparable operations.

* sample_draw_console.rb shows how to use the BinaryDrawer class. 

* sample_draw_html.rb is a more complex example that generates an HTML file to draw the tree using HTML 5's canvas feature.

* binarytree.rb has the binary tree implementation.

* binarytreedrawer.rb has the code to draw the tree.

* Files tc_*.rb are the unit tests and are another good place to start.


COMMENTS, THOUGHTS, SUGGESTIONS?
--------------------------------
This is my first Ruby program so very likely it does not follow Ruby's best practices or the Ruby way of doing things but it's a start. 

Feel free to comment and/or reach me if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.
